# TECOD
TECOD was a more advanced version of the TAPCOD program and replaced the latter when commercial email services became available in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It dispensed with the need to record the digital output through an acoustic modem onto a tape recorder. It worked through a regular modem with the email services offered by providers such as British Telecom and CompuServe.
